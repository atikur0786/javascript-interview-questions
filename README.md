### 1. What is JavaScript and how is it different from Java?

**JavaScript** is a lightweight, interpreted, high-level programming language that is primarily used to build dynamic and interactive web pages. It is a **core technology of the web**, alongside HTML and CSS.

Despite the similar names, **JavaScript and Java are completely different languages** in terms of design, syntax, and use cases.

#### ‚úÖ Key Characteristics of JavaScript:

- **Interpreted** (not compiled)
- **Dynamically typed**
- **Prototype-based inheritance**
- Runs in the browser and also on the server (Node.js)
- Supports **event-driven**, **asynchronous**, and **functional** programming

#### ‚úÖ Differences Between JavaScript and Java:

| Feature         | JavaScript                                   | Java                                       |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Type**        | Scripting Language                           | Object-Oriented Programming Language       |
| **Execution**   | Interpreted                                  | Compiled (into bytecode, then run on JVM)  |
| **Environment** | Browser, Node.js                             | JVM (Java Virtual Machine)                 |
| **Typing**      | Dynamically typed                            | Statically typed                           |
| **Syntax**      | Loosely written (no class needed)            | Strict class-based syntax                  |
| **Concurrency** | Event-driven, non-blocking (single-threaded) | Multi-threaded via threads                 |
| **Use Case**    | Web interactivity, frontend/backend logic    | Enterprise apps, Android, desktop, backend |

#### üìå Example:

**JavaScript**

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("Atikur")); // Hello, Atikur!
```

**Java**

```java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(greet("Atikur"));
  }

  static String greet(String name) {
    return "Hello, " + name + "!";
  }
}
```

#### üß† Summary:

- JavaScript is used primarily for **web development**, while Java is used for **enterprise, Android, and backend** applications.
- JavaScript is **loosely typed and dynamic**, whereas Java is **strongly typed and static**.
- They **do not share any runtime, libraries, or design philosophy** despite having similar names.
